# solar-portfolio
A signle raw HTML/CSS portfolio page, inspired by [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color palette.


It should serve as a brief introduction about the guy the website is about,
my goal is to keep it as simple as possible with the least amount of 3rd party usage.

For now it uses the following deps :
* Font Awesome: just for glyphicons for now.

### Todo: 
* Use more monospace fonts.
